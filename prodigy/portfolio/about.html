        <h2>Hello! I'm Hetvi Parmar</h2>
        <p>
          I am a passionate Full-Stack Developer with a focus on the MERN
          (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.I pursing B.E information
          technology a degree in from GTU. Over the years, I have honed my
          skills by working on diverse and challenging projects, gaining
          extensive experience in both front-end and back-end development.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my key projects is a **frontend e-commerce platform** where I
          implemented features such as product listings, user authentication,
          and shopping cart functionality, all with a clean and responsive
          design.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also developed a **food order application** using the MERN stack.
          This project involved creating a user-friendly interface for browsing
          menus, placing orders, and tracking delivery status. The backend
          efficiently handles order processing, user data, and real-time
          updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I built a **movie database application** where users can
          search for movies, view details, and create watchlists. This project
          included both a dynamic frontend in React and a robust backend to
          manage movie data, user information, and interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          My expertise also extends to designing databases and ensuring their
          seamless integration with web applications. I am adept at using
          MongoDB for data storage and management, ensuring optimal performance
          and scalability.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to
          open-source projects, and continuously improving my coding skills. I
          am always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate on exciting
          projects.
        </p>
